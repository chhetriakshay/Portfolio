            <p>In the year 2015, The famous motor company Volkswagen admitted officially that its vehicles contained a cheating software called Defeat Device Software. The term Defeat device is a US Environmental Protection Agency term which means a technology that would cause a vehicle to behave differently in the laboratory then how it actually perform i.e on road.</p>

                <p>There were boards called, the EPA and the California Air Resources Board which issued notices of violation(NoVs) to Volkswagen. The notices revealed that there were numerous dishonest actions on Volkswagens part. It was found that the company installed defeat devices knowingly that it would amount to the violation of the federal Clean Air Act. The Chairman too accepted the fact that there were breaches of rules and the attitude was tolerated by the company.</p>
                
                <p>Even during the application for the Certificate of Conformity, certain aspects were hidden and these aspects lead to the violation of both the federal and state laws. The dishonesty on part of the engineers, supervisors and higher officials dented the hard earned reputation and also credibility of the company.
                Two fact finding committee, one an internal and the other an external were constituted in-order to check the errors and it was found that there were series of errors, violations committed by those in the chain of responsibility.</p>
                
                <p>Its known that there tends to be errors related to engineering and rightly so many are caused due to computational factors but the question in case of Volkswagens wasn’t about mistakes but that of falsehood. There was a deliberate decision to do wrong and the members associated with the company chose to do so. The misdeeds were carried on for as long as seven years. The supervisors and higher ups released the vehicles into the market despite knowing that there was deceit involved while quality checking the vehicles. When they were challenged by regulators then they made false representations on behalf of Volkswagen.</p>
                
                <p>Its understandable that the company asked time and patience to investigate the wrong doings but these investigations usually take months to come to a conclusion. It would also take years for the court to give justice as the legal process will be related to the investigation report. The engineers shouldn’t wait to report wrong practices as engineering and morals should have been interrelated.
                The intention is to help engineers to see the perils of following dishonest policies, leaving morals no matter where they are working at.</p>
                The article tries to find a possible explanation as to why the engineers at Volkswagen did that they did. Why didn’t they go for the alternate option of developing the low emission engine itself. There are two chronologies that comes into picture. One being why was the defeat device brought into picture along with its production and the other being why did the company deny to the regulators regarding the fraud they committed. The challenges posed by cyberthreat and the ethical breakdown is also discussed.</p>
                
                <p>There were four dysfunctional practices that took at Volkswagen which indicated the departure of good engineering practice from the core value. Dishonesty is the most common trait in these practices.
                The four dysfunctional practices were:
                <ol>
                    <li>Pursuit of non-feasible objectives with no tolerance for failure.</li>
                    <li>Suppression of communication.</li>
                    <li>Software creation for cheating.</li>
                    <li>Dishonesty</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>German engineering in general is one where there is exemplary skill, thoroughness, and reliability. The engineers are very much familiar with the precision, capabilities, limit,  potentiality of their product. In case of Volkswagen these qualities were ignored. They let the rampant corruption and inefficiency to creep in. With time these non ethical practices became bolder in nature and with time it threatened the company as a whole.
                Although the company tried to control the damages its employees had caused to its reputation but in the process of controlling the damages too they emphasised on things they wanted from their customers instead of doing things it owes to its customer i.e honest engineering.</p>
                
                <p>The chronology of events that lead to the Defeat Device Software:
                Insistence on Infeasible Objectives: The company tried to set targets beyond reality. The CEO had a high expectation of surpassing rival automobile company Toyota. There was no honest way of reaching the required unrealistic target by the CEO, hence, dishonest methods had to be creeped in to achieve the target. One of the issue related to NOx is related to diesel engines. The top executives in consultation considered the option to shrug off their target of achieving a clean diesel engine as they didn’t have the technology to do so also they didn’t want to ask for help from their rivals. They stopped the urea-based treatment that’s used in order to remove NOx pollutants. Instead of asking its engineers to find a solution they took the easy decision of scrapping the licence of the urea-based treatment and going forward with the old technology. They also placed price, performance, time-frame and technological bounds  on the available solutions and these were just infeasible. There behaviour of the CEO was also autocratic. When asked about the probability of engines not being able to meet the required norm, he straightaway told that the engineers would be fired. This intimidation too played a major role in the implementation of the defeat device software. It was assumed that if an illicit way was possible then it would be tolerated provided the targets are met.</p>
                
                <p>The decision to implement these cheating devices were a deliberate one where the engineers and the higher ups had absolute knowledge of the deceitful tactics they were using. They knew that the software could be used as a cheating device as Bosch itself warned the company through a letter regarding the flaws the software has. The engineers very slyly checked for the methods used to detect emissions so that the loopholes could be exploited to fit their software in place. Testing the device to check if it actually reduce NOx emissions below the test limits. The chain of command was fully aware of such practices. When called upon to discuss the emissions by CARB Chair, they simply ignored it. While launching its new vehicles to the market they knowingly lied to the consumers and the authorities stating that they did modifications on the engine and on the exhaust system and helped in reducing the NOx levels by up to 90 percent whereas in reality they didn’t do any of those mentioned. The mentioned model of cars also received awards which were undeserving in nature.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The Suppression of Open Communication:</li> 
                <p>In this case there was an environment created in which the engineers couldn’t communicate freely when approaching a solution to a problem. As its known that engineering is a space where there is always a need to teamwork. Effective collaboration is the key and it thrives on open communication. The requirement of effective communication is needed more where the problems are complex. But in the case of Volkswagen working environment the open communication was lacking. It was more of a culture where the fear of getting fired for raising right voices was rampant. The report by a prominent newspaper states the CEO was known for his autocratic, corrosive culture where dissent was not tolerated. Opinions were ignored and at the best suppressed. The executives were used to getting what they wanted and a bad news was not the one.</p>
                
            <li>The use of corrupt software:</li>
                <p>The company wrote codes that gave the vehicle two operating modes. But these codes were hidden from the authorities. There was an implementation of a switching option which used to detect if the machine was operating in a test or highway condition. If the vehicle was in the testing stage then the optimization of the vehicle would take place and which would give a good result. To produce such algorithms there was a need of engineers to conceive the idea, verify the computer code and then implement it. There would have been numerous tests and redesign and verification process. There was a need of systems which would mimic the system used by the central testing agency to give a go ahead to the vehicle production and delivery. The company extensively researched about it in order to make their deceiving device a fault proof one. When the software producing agency Bosch came to know about Volkswagen intent to use the software in the production cars, it shot off a letter to the company of its illegal usage. These letters were ignored by the engineers and executives altogether. There’s also a feature which warns users of the pollution levels emitted by the vehicle. Volkswagen engineers tweaked this feature in order to hide their deceit from consumers as well as regulators. It was found later that the emission of NOx was 9 times the standard applicable level. This form of writing a software code used to create a cheat which is then disguised as a solution shows a new form of cyber-threat. The code is written to satisfy an engineering objective but it downplays the other objective of testing. This form of deceit helps in bring about substandard products in the market. Honesty plays a big role on part of the engineer, superiors, to bring about the news of deceit brought about by the company.</p>
                
                <li>The Denials:</li>
                <p>The company denied the presence of any such cheat devices when confronted by the regulators. There is no visible report which states that the company admitted to the presence of such devices until it faced unbearable commercial consequences. Only when the EPA threatened to prevent the import by withholding the needed certification did the company reveal about the deceits. The company was positive that it would manage the consequences with proper damage control. The post disclosure communication from the company was also one where there was no admission in a firm way. There was even an instance in 2015 where the company stated that there was no defeat device present but later admitted to the EPA official in a hidden fashion.</p>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The company tried to shrug-off responsibility by passing it on to the officers below C-level officers. Their internal interim report by the company stated the software influenced NOx emissions behaviour was due to three factors:
                <ol>
                    <li>The misconduct and shortcomings of individual employees.</li>
                    <li>Weakness in some processes.</li>
            	    <li>Mindset in some area of the Company that tolerated breaches of the rules.</li>
                </ol>
                
                
                <p>There is a focus on individual employees and that is a worrisome issue. The top level officers are not responsible enough to create a working environment free from errors. The chairman too follows the same trait as he has drawn a distinction between being honest and more honest. The company also had rules which were sufficient enough if only some areas of the company hadn’t developed a mindset that tolerated breaches of the rules.</p>
                As its known that Leaders are some whose aim is to create a working environment where the individuals are both motivated and accepted to achieve the company’s goals and achievements. The complex codes formed are just a tool used by leaders to communicate. The code of conduct lists standards which might have prevented the deceit that took place but on further close examination there is a consistence with the four dysfunctional practices. The code puts the highest priority on the reputation of Volkswagen as away to promote its strategy. The company directs its employees to adhere to the codes that, the reputation of the company is kept on a pedestal. The tone of the code is also an autocratic one. As observed in other companies. They talk about the enterprise as “we” which puts the  standards of behaviour in the context of something greater. The code also doesn’t demand the honouring of a set of ethical principles to be followed. Its easily concludable from the code that the principled judgement and honesty are secondary as compared to demeanour, actions, behaviour, reputation, performance. The greatest sin is to damage the company repute and then deviating from rule based norms. The CEO’s announcement which emphasises on entrepreneurs is a noteworthy one. It has no use of ethical and honest use of technology. Its observed that a company which has Volkswagens code will also be the one where the ethical principles would not be followed. It states the juniors to follow seniors directive. The requirement to act strict does not emphasise on making poor decisions. It provides the seniors with a tool that forces the subordinates to achieve a goal without fail no matter the moral consequences. The code required the employees to treat the product as a trade secret and due to this the secret had been maintained for five years. Its only when there was a discovery outside the company the environmental fraud came out to the general public. A drastic change is required in the code of conduct in-order to avoid such frauds.</p>
                
                <p>Events after the disclosure:
                The code of conduct was just a slight introduction to the culture inside Volkswagen. The denial of the wrongdoing at post disclosure statements gives more information about the work culture and ethics inside the company’s higher hierarchical officials. The denial of EPA and CARB findings, later acceptance when forced with hard evidence shows the company had much to hide.
                It was also found that the company had been more than willing to neglect emission laws earlier.</p>
                <p>The company’s deceit had been caught and it has backfired. The US department of Justice filed a complaint covering the use of defeat devices and there is now a condition where Volkswagen must negotiate for a settlement worth Billions in fines. The fines can exceed the profits Volkswagen made by selling the cars containing the devices. The company also trust which might never return. Bringing about ethical change might also be an issue.</p>
                
                <p>A good engineering design must avoid failure but in the case of Volkswagen the dishonesty has resulted in complete failure of the company itself. The secrecy of 7 years also employees were dishonest and had side-lined ethics. A long term exposure to such environment where dishonesty is tolerated can lead to long term ethical degradation from ones life. This is also known as mettle fatigue. When one enters a company which implements corrupt software knowingly one is bound to be a corrupt due to the environmental influences.</p>
                
                <p>One who stayed in Volkswagen ensured its fall by keeping mum. The software they developed an implemented put peoples lives at risk. It lead to job losses, environmental losses, monetary losses and also the loss of a brand image.
                Trust was also a huge casualty as the corrupt software implementation lead to environmental impact by 11 million cars. It betrayed the buyers who believed they were doing something that would lessen their contribution to climate change. Instead the opposite has happened, also the resale value of the car has also been hit because of it. People put their trust in machines and the ones who create them and software’s are a part of them. Its up to the programmers and engineers to keep the trust intact.</p>
                <p>Since Volkswagen codes were an instrument which showed the culture it has so does the codes of engineering. The IEEE codes makes an engineer to commit to accept responsibility in making consistent decisions with safety of the public and to disclose factors which might effect the public. Although the spokesperson from the company states the car is safe to drive but it does not address the respiratory impact of the NOx emitted. The IEEE code asks engineers be honest. The engineers of Volkswagen who worked on the software were honest only to their supervisors but not to their engineering codes. The IEEE too should amend their codes and add a word or two about tolerating colleagues, seniors without codes or those who violate them.</p>
                <p>The best option that Volkswagen has right now is to take the topic of mettle fatigue with full seriousness as it’s a danger to both the engineers as well as the company. The other companies should learn from mistakes Volkswagen committed and be safe rather than sorry.

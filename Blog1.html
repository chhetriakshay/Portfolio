            <p>How does one arrive at a point of solid ground in a situation of uncertainity? By asking questions.
                <br>
            There's no other creature in this world who has the time, energy and brain to pursue knowledge for its own sake. Why?
                <br>
            Reasearch suggests that the curiosity for explanation is in place at the very beginning of human life.
            <br>
            In human beings, evolution seemed to have discovered that it's cost effective to spport basic research instead of funding just directed application. Also Each one of us has a bank of knowledge or patterns hidden inside the brain. This is the content of our consciousness, of everything we have ever known and accumulated in the past. When we observe something new or different that does not fit into the stored memories, knowledge or the patterns stored in the brain, if it does not fit into what we already know or cannot be deduced from what we already know, we invariably raise a question. By doing so, we are trying to seek out an explanation from the field of the known, from what we already know, and if we get a reply that can “fit in”, we feel satisfied that our question has been answered.
            <br>
            In conclusion it's because:
             <ul>
                <li>We have a profound need to understand how life works</li>
                <li>We have a thirst for knowledge that doesn’t go away
                <li>The answers to our questions aren’t always obvious</li>
                <li>It’s never too early to start contemplating ideas</li>
                <li>It’s never too late to find out the truth</li>
                <li>We are curious</li>
                <li>We don’t know everything</li>
                <li>We like to question things</li>
                <li>It boosts our critical thinking skills</li>
                <li>It’s a shortcut to learning new things</li>
                <li>We want to understand the big picture</li>
                <li>We’re not always satisfied with the status quo</li>
                <li>There’s always more to find out, observe, analyze, and process</li>
                <li>It keeps our mind active, constantly in motion, limitless</li>
                <li>It often reveals the pieces of our hidden selves, the
                things we think and care about the most</li>
